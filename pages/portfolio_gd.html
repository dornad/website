			<h2>Game Design</h2>
				<p class="double-spacing">Game Design is a project-based graduate
				course at Carnegie Mellon University taught brilliantly by <a
				href="http://www.jesseschell.com/">Jesse Schell</a>. The class focuses on the
				mechanics and processes of good game design, via lectures given by Schell and
				the design and implementation of games in several formats. Students must design
				and develop these games based on given constraints and iterate on them,
				documenting the process thoroughly.</p>
				<p class="double-spacing">As a programmer, I took this class in order
				to broaden my skills and learn about a subject that would make me a better team
				player in a game development group. Below are the links to the assignments that
				were completed for this course. All documents are in PDF format.</p>
				<!-- -->
				<h3 class="project-item">
					Redesigning Hopscotch 
					<a href="../docs/RodriguezDanielHopscotch.pdf" 
					style="color:#8D8D8D">(PDF File)</a>
				</h3>
				<p class="double-spacing">The course's first assignment is to
				redesign Hopscotch. Over the period of one week, students must come up with at
				least 50 possible redesign ideas, flesh out three and implement one. The idea
				to be implemented must be iterated upon at least three times.</p>
				<!-- -->
				<h3 class="project-item">
					Design Toolbox 
					<a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AlJOeGYIrK7OdHlpdlFZUlJfWFAxTWYtTmVqMDA5bFE&amp;hl=en#gid=0" 
					style="color:#8D8D8D">(Link)</a>
				</h3>
				<p class="double-spacing">A Google Spreadsheet containing every game
				I have ever played. There are some that I have missed, no doubt, and there are
				others whose names are in my native language Spanish. Some of them you may not
				recognize because they are from Bogotá, Colombia. I try to keep it up to date
				as much as I can, as well as comment on each game to some degree.</p>
				<!-- -->
				<h3 class="project-item">
					Dice Game 
					<a href="../docs/RodriguezDanielDice.pdf" 
					style="color:#8D8D8D">(PDF File)</a>
				</h3>
				<p class="double-spacing">A two week-long assignment with the goal of
				designing a dice game that had to go through at least 12 play testing sessions
				and iterations. Special emphasis had to be made on interpreting playtester's
				feedback. I designed a cross between Jenga! and a regular dice game.</p>				
				<!-- -->
				<h3 class="project-item">
					Adventure Game 
					<a href="../docs/RodriguezDanielAdventure.pdf" 
					style="color:#8D8D8D">(PDF File)</a>
				</h3>
				<p class="double-spacing">This assignment required students to design
				a three hour-long adventure campaign for any tabletop roleplaying system, and
				run it for three players. I created an adventure game based on the ever-popular
				Macross universe. The final report includes an analysis of Interest Curves
				drawn by each player.</p>				
				<!-- -->
				<h3 class="project-item">
					Freestyle Game
					<a href="../docs/RodriguezDanielLabeikovskyNadiaFreestyleDesignDoc.pdf" 
					style="color:#8D8D8D">(PDF File)</a>
				</h3>
				<p class="double-spacing">This assignment required students to work
				on a freestyle game of our own choice. I teamed with a fellow student and decided to 
				expand upon our love of LucasArts graphic adventure games (think Maniac Mansion, Indiana 
				Jones and the Fate of Atlantis, Monkey Island, Full Throttle and Grim Fandango). Our game 
				prototype was built using Lassie Adventure Studio, a game engine for these kind of games
				written in Flash.</p>
